# Homeserver Dashboard Environment Variables
#
# Copy this file to .env.local (or .env) and fill in your values.
# .env.local takes precedence over .env and is typically gitignored.
#
# To use mock mode (for development without a real homeserver):
# 1. Set ADMIN_MOCK=1
# 2. You can leave ADMIN_BASE_URL and ADMIN_TOKEN empty in mock mode
#
# To connect to a real homeserver:
# 1. Set ADMIN_MOCK=0 (or remove the variable)
# 2. Set ADMIN_BASE_URL to your homeserver admin endpoint
# 3. Set ADMIN_TOKEN to your admin password/token

# Homeserver admin endpoint base URL
# Example: http://localhost:8080
# Example: https://homeserver.example.com
ADMIN_BASE_URL=

# Admin authentication token/password
# This is the password configured in your homeserver's AdminAuthLayer
# Example: my-secure-admin-password
ADMIN_TOKEN=
